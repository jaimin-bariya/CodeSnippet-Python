# Python Generators: Real-World Use Cases

Generators in Python are extremely versatile and can be used in many real-world scenarios where **memory efficiency** and **lazy evaluation** are essential. Here are some common **use cases** for generators:

## **1. Reading Large Files Line by Line**

When dealing with large files, you may not want to load the entire file into memory at once. Generators allow you to read and process files line by line.

**Use Case:**
- **Log file analysis:** Processing large server log files without loading the entire file into memory.

**Example:**
```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line  # Yield each line one by one

# Usage
for line in read_large_file('large_log_file.txt'):
    print(line)


2. Streaming Data Processing
In scenarios where you receive data in streams (e.g., from a network socket or real-time data feeds), generators allow you to process data as it arrives without waiting for the complete dataset.

Use Case:

Real-time data analysis: Processing data from APIs or sensors.
Example:
